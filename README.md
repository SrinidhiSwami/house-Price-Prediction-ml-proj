##Overview

This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python. It includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.
The dataset is included in the project folder.

##Steps in the Notebook

1. Imports and Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. One-Hot Encoding
5. Train–Test Split
6. Model Training
Models used:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Regressor
Linear Regression
7. Model Evaluation

Make predictions

Calculate evaluation metrics such as MAE/accuracy
